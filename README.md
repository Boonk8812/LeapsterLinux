LeapsterLinux is a Linux distro made for your Leapfrog Leapad and/or Leapster or Leapfrog device. It is powered by the Linux kernel and supports the Leapfrog touch screen to control it. We were originally going to call it LeapOS, but that name wasn't really resonating with us. So we picked LeapsterLinux as the name!


**How do I get it installed?**


For LeapPads:

While the device is completely shut down, hold down the right arrow button on the D-Pad along with the home button, then a screen with the LeapPad and a computer should appear after 5 seconds. Then connect your USB cable to a nearby PC an then connect it to the LeapPad.
